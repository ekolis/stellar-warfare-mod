The first Damage Type must be "Normal" damage. 


*** Damage Application ***
1.  If there are special effects, execute them. Skip all remaining steps. 
2.  Add Abilities to firing component (level is the level of the component). 
3.  Find Vehicle Type (default value 100%) - 
    a. If this is the target vehicle type (or planet) then dmg_amt = dmg_amt * damage percent. 
4.  Find Shield Type (default values 0%, 100%) - 
    a. If hitting this shield type:
    b. Subtract (dmg_amt * Penetration Percent) from the current damage amount. This is the Penetration Damage. 
    c. dmg_amt := dmg_amt * Damage Percent. 
    d. Apply dmg_amt to the shields.
    e. Remaining damage after application is set to dmg_amt := dmg_amt / Damage Percent.
    f. Add to dmg_amt the Penetration Damage. Penetration damage skips the level and goes to the next. 
5.  Find Armor Type (default values 0%, 100%) - 
    a. If hitting this armor type:
    b. Subtract (dmg_amt * Penetration Percent) from the current damage amount. This is the Penetration Damage. 
    c. dmg_amt := dmg_amt * Damage Percent. 
    d. Apply dmg_amt to the armor components of this armor type.
    e. Remaining damage after application is set to dmg_amt := dmg_amt / Damage Percent.
    f. Add to dmg_amt the Penetration Damage. Penetration damage skips the level and goes to the next. 
6.  dmg_amt := dmg_amt * Internal Damage Percent. If damage amount is zero, then skip all remaining steps.   
7.  Create a list of all components that meet the requirements from the outer hull. (facilities if this is a planet)
8.  Apply damage to these components. If all components are destroyed and there is damage remaining, proceed to the next step. 
9.  Create a list of all components that meet the requirements from the inner hull. (facilities if this is a planet)
10. Apply damage to these components. If the ship is still alive after all damage applied, proceed to the next step. 

*** If a section is left blank, default values apply. 
*** Ex. If no shield types are listed, then the default of 100% damage, and 0% penetration is used for all shield types.
