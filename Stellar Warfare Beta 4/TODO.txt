Todo for beta 4a:

Rearrange components to a nicer grouping (keep all comps of same group together)

Add "satellite" hull (800kT base available with Planetary Industry)

Increase planets per system (check Sojourner Mod)

Reduce occurrence of binary/trinary systems or add planets to them (check Sojourner Mod)

Add 40/60/80kT "mine" hulls, warheads, and thrusters (a la DJAS Mod)

Disable savegame compression

Make "special" planets less rare

Adjust scoring values since resources etc. are less plentiful

Antimatter damage should not have 20% penetration vs. latium armor!

Add small amount of innate supply/ordnance/cargo storage for planets

Add resource storage facilities/components

Reduce cost of SY's

Increase planetary facility space

Add repair bays, or move 'em up to appear sooner in the tech tree (add Engineering Bays at top level which repair damage in combat???)
