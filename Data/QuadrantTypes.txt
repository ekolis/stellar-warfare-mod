Quadrant Map Size = 68x50

Min Dist Between Systems:
  The minimum number of system squares that must be between each 
  system on the map. A value of 1 would mean that no 2 systems can 
  fall exactly next to each other, there must be at least 1 square 
  distance.

System Placement:
  Random, Clusters, Spiral, Diffuse, Grid

Max Warp Points per Sys:
  Maximum number of warp points given to each system on the first pass. This can
  be overriden to ensure connectivity.

Min Angle Between WP:
  The minimum angle allowed between two warp points in the same system. This can
  be overriden to ensure connectivity.

Number of System Types:
  The number of system types that will be used in this quadrant. 

Type # Name:
  The name of the system type that will be used (from the
  SystemTypes.txt file)

Type # Chance:
  The percent chance of a system being of this type. Chances are in 10ths of 
  a percentage (500 = 50%).  All of the Chance's should add up to 
  1000 for a Quadrant Type.

Number of Locations:
  The number of specific system placement locations.

Location # System Type:
  The system type that should be used at this location.

Location # Position X:
  The quadrant map x location for this system. 

Location # Position Y:
  The quadrant map Y location for this system.
